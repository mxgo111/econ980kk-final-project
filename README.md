# econ980kk-final-project
Final Project for Econ980KK, Spring 2023: Solving Schumpeterian Models of Business Process and Product Innovation using Reinforcement Learning

The folders are structured to contain the following:
- `abs_data` contains data from the Annual Business Survey 2015-2017 and the plots of product and business process innovation that result.
- `barro-ch7-simulations` contains a file that simulates the results from Barro and Sala-i-Martin, Chapter 7.
- `model1` contains all files specifying and solving the first, single-agent model of product and business process innovation.
- `model2` contains preliminary work for specifying and solving the second, multi-agent model of product and business process innovation, though it currently only supports product innovation.
- `robustness-figures` contains the figures generated for checking the robustness of the innovation rate distribution simulated results to difference parameter values.
